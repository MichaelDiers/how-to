# [Cryptography](Crypto)

Encrypt and decrypt data using [RSA](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/rsa), [AES](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/advanced_encryption_standard) and a combination of both algorithms. Shows how to create and process a custom [AES](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/advanced_encryption_standard) header.

- [AES and Brotli](Crypto/AesBrotliHowTo.cs) combined to compress and encrypt data.
- Use [AES](Crypto/AesHowTo.cs) to encrypt and decrypt data using a symmetric key.
- A combination of [RSA and AES](Crypto/RsaAesHowTo.cs): Use [AES](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/advanced_encryption_standard) to encrypt data and [RSA](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/rsa) to encrypt the [AES](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/advanced_encryption_standard) key.
- Use [RSA](Crypto/RsaHowTo.cs) to encrypt and decrypt data using private and public keys.
